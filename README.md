🎸 Silence of Thoughts

A band that thinks in echoes and plays in shadows.

🧠 About

Silence of Thoughts is a retro-inspired band from Lichtenfels, Oberfranken. Our sound blends introspective lyrics, warm analog textures, and a touch of candlelit melancholy. We believe music should feel like memory — flickering, fragile, and full of depth.

🖼️ Visual Identity

Our artwork is inspired by mid-century design, comic-style silhouettes, and the texture of old paper. Each logo, splash screen, and header reflects the mood of our music — thoughtful, minimal, and slightly mysterious.
